# Popup Settings Fix Test

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Popup showed "API Status: Not configured" even when API key was entered in settings.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between settings structure in options.js vs popup.js
- options.js was saving: `openaiApiKey`
- popup.js was looking for: `aiSettings.apiKey`

**Solution**: Updated popup.js to use the same settings structure as options.js.

## 🧪 Test Steps

### 1. Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find your extension
3. Click the reload button (↻) to reload the extension

### 2. Configure API Key
1. Click the extension icon in toolbar
2. Click "Open Settings" button
3. Enter your OpenAI API key in the "API Key" field
4. The key should start with `sk-` and be about 50+ characters
5. Settings should auto-save (you'll see a success notification)

### 3. Test Popup Status
1. Close the settings page
2. Click the extension icon again
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - ✅ **API Status**: Should now show "Connected" (green)
   - ✅ If on a Notion page: "Current Page: Notion page detected" (green)
   - ✅ If not on Notion: "Current Page: Not on Notion" (orange)

### 4. Test on Notion Page
1. Navigate to any Notion page (notion.so or notion.site)
2. Click the extension icon
3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ **API Status**: "Connected" (green)
   - ✅ **Current Page**: "Notion page detected" (green)
   - ✅ **Quick Actions section**: Visible with "Generate Content" button
   - ✅ **Templates section**: Visible with template options
   - ✅ **"Generate Content" button**: Should be enabled and clickable

## 🎯 Success Criteria

## 🐛 If Still Having Issues

1. **Clear Extension Data**: 
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click "Details" on your extension
   - Click "Extension options"
   - Try entering the API key again

2. **Check Browser Console**:
